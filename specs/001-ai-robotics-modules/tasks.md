## Dependencies

1. **Setup Phase** must complete before any User Story phases
2. **Foundational Phase** must complete before User Story phases begin
3. **User Story phases** can proceed in parallel but all must complete before Polish phase
4. **Module-specific tasks** within each User Story must complete before that story is considered finished

## Parallel Execution Examples

- Tasks T020, T021 can run in parallel with T033, T034 (Module 1 and Module 2 research)
- Tasks T046, T047 can run in parallel with T059, T060 (Module 3 and Module 4 research)
- Tasks T022-T025 can run in parallel with T035-T038 (Module 1 and Module 2 content creation)
- Tasks T048-T051 can run in parallel with T061-T064 (Module 3 and Module 4 content creation)

## Implementation Strategy

**MVP Scope**: Complete User Story 1 (Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System) as a fully functional prototype demonstrating the complete pipeline from sensing → reasoning → action.

**Incremental Delivery**: Each module completion provides independent value while building toward the complete 4-module system. Modules can be released incrementally if needed.

**Quality Focus**: Each task includes validation steps to ensure specification compliance, APA citation requirements, and content quality standards.
