# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

Welcome to the comprehensive guide on Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics. This book is designed for advanced students and developers in AI, robotics, and software engineering working on embodied intelligence and humanoid systems.

## Overview

This educational resource covers the complete pipeline from sensing to reasoning to action in embodied AI systems, with a focus on bridging digital intelligence with humanoid robot bodies through middleware, simulation, perception, and language-driven action.

## Book Structure

The content is organized into four comprehensive modules:

### Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)
Focus: Middleware for humanoid robot control
- ROS 2 Architecture: Nodes, Topics, and Services
- Bridging Python AI Agents to ROS Controllers with rclpy
- Humanoid Modeling with URDF

### Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)
Focus: Physics simulation and environment building
- Physics, Gravity, and Collision Simulation in Gazebo
- High-Fidelity Rendering and Human–Robot Interaction in Unity
- Sensor Simulation: LiDAR, Depth Cameras, and IMUs

### Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac™)
Focus: Advanced perception and navigation
- NVIDIA Isaac Sim and Synthetic Data Generation
- Isaac ROS: Hardware-Accelerated VSLAM and Navigation
- Nav2 for Bipedal Humanoid Path Planning

### Module 4: Vision–Language–Action (VLA)
Focus: LLMs integrated with robotics
- Voice-to-Action Systems Using OpenAI Whisper
- Cognitive Planning with LLMs for ROS 2 Action Sequences
- Capstone: The Autonomous Humanoid Robot

## Learning Path

Each module contains three structured chapters that progressively build on each other, allowing you to understand how AI perception, planning, and control connect in physical systems. The content is designed to help you describe the full pipeline from sensing → reasoning → action.

## Technical Requirements

This book assumes familiarity with:
- Basic robotics concepts
- Programming experience (preferably Python)
- Understanding of AI and machine learning fundamentals

## Citation Standards

All sources in this book follow APA 7th edition format to ensure academic rigor and reproducibility.

Begin your journey by exploring the modules through the navigation menu, starting with Module 1 or proceeding to Module 2: The Digital Twin for the current focus on simulation environments.
